#### **Empowered Communities**

![benefits2][]Effective teams are defined by close communication and
collaboration; that is the very definition of “teamwork”. But recurring
meetings and mass emails overwhelm inboxes and schedules. The answer to
effectiveness is social media/knowledge exchanges. This avenue enables
efficient communications and collaboration because they are online,
available at any time and place. Community meetings/discussions are
convenient for the participants and thus are much more likely to get
useful, thoughtful contributions that move the team forward.

#### **Benefits - Community interactions providing   
insights that lead to:**

-   Faster adoption of new products and programs because roadblocks have
    been addressed; consensus reached
-   Building of comprehensive best practices
-   Building requirements for new projects and best practices,
    especially around new technology
-   Developing effective messages for new product rollout
-   Identifying of thought leaders based on their community contribution

> **Why this is important...  
> **To understand the likelihood and quality of your success; to
> maximize your success; to navigate roadblocks to your success

#### **Metrics- The Effectiveness of Your Community:**

Are your participants listening?

-   Do they understand?
-   Are they responding?
-   Do they check back?
-   Are they committed?
-   Is there consensus?
-   How broad is the community reach...
-   Does it foster grassroots feedback?
