Recent CMS Administrator Dr. Donald Berwick states that “tempo” is his
key priority for improving the quality, safety, and cost of America’s
healthcare. Knowledge, skills, and standards exist—but hospitals move
too slowly in putting these strengths to work.

Consider how difficult it is to coordinate clinical and operational
improvement initiatives that affect multiple service lines; especially
in the new ACA environment. ACO models now need to focus on the
efficiency of care delivery as intently as they used to focus on
clinical care.

Unfortunately it is all the harder to overcome traditional, outdated
ways of doing things especially given the increased work load of the
problem solving community. They often are in different environmental
silos which reduces consensus and ultimate adoption. Email boxes
overflow. time is burned up in meetings. Group conference calls are
difficult to attend. Webinars and blogs induce too little interaction.
New ideas and even new potential leaders cannot penetrate through the
clutter.
