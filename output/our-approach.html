</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Our approach is to build an <strong>empowered community</strong>. Let users navigate
with their browsers to pose questions, add images and hyperlinks, upload
documents and test answers, offer insights easily. Supply added
resources through a Web 2.0 ontological as well as traditional APIs. Get
knowledge organized automatically as the community ranks its content and
prioritizes its findings. By doing so we harness the power of
conversations taking place in a community. In conjunction with typical
hard informational assets such as databases, reports, articles, and
research publications, capturing the informal dialog of a professional
community maximizes a community’s brain trust. Combining such data with
research accelerates the adoption of best practices essential to solving
complex problems in the healthcare industry.</p>

<h4>An empowered community provides the leverage to get more done</h4>
<p>Incorporating grass roots dialog into an information strategy empowers
the community itself to convey quality healthcare delivery solutions
quickly and cost effectively. Proprietary design methods allow us to
analyze this social fabric of a community: How consensus was reached;
who was involved; what resources did they use; what impact and
implications can be derived? This process is particularly important
given the sheer number of interested parties that need to be aligned.
<span style="color: #800000;"><em>Email, conference calls, and
face-to-face meetings are inadequate to meet such complexity.</em></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Disruptive Innovation – Foundational factors include leveraging knowledge wherever it is found</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Catalyze community innovation from the inside-</em>that is where the
    knowledge is.</li>
<li><em>Use methods that are effective and scalable-</em>be able to support
    thousands of members and millions of discussions. Fewer committee
    meetings, seminars, reply-all emails.</li>
<li><em>Utilize all eyes on the ground -</em>no restrictions, geographic or
    hierarchical, means all members of a community are able, and
    encouraged, to contribute.</li>
<li><em>Permit the community, not an outsider, to set the bar</em> - seed a
    culture of innovation by creating an environment that rewards those
    who are willing to contribute; an <em>“it’s your house”</em> mentality to
    encourage broad conversation that leads to improvement.</li>
<li><em>Ease of use</em> – Our Kx^TM^ is easier to use than email. It is easy
    to integrate multiple forms of media (data, text, video, articles)
    in support of a user’s position and can be accessed by all browser
    connectable devices.</li>
<li><em>Ongoing learning -</em>extendsthe ability for a community to maintain a
    "learning collaborative base camp."</li>
</ul>
<p>Our exchange serves as the communications backbone of what quickly
becomes a tightly-knit learning collaborative—no matter whether there
are dozens or hundreds of users engaged in the initiative.</p>
